JobQ API
========

The JobQ API allows you to retrieve finished jobs from the queue.

.. include:: client_library.rst

jobq/:project_id/count
----------------------

Count the jobs for the specified project.

========= ========================================================== ========
Parameter Description                                                Required
========= ========================================================== ========
spider    Filter results by spider name.                             No
state     Filter results by state (pending/running/finished/deleted) No
startts   UNIX timestamp at which to begin results, in milliseconds. No
endts     UNIX timestamp at which to end results, in milliseconds.   No
has_tag   Filter results by existing tags                            No
lacks_tag Filter results by missing tags                             No
========= ========================================================== ========

.. hint:: It's possible to repeat ``has_tag``, ``lacks_tag`` multiple times. In this case ``has_tag`` works as an ``OR`` operation, while ``lacks_tag`` works as an ``AND`` operation.

HTTP (assuming only 2 jobs, where 1st one is marked with ``tagA``, 2nd - with ``tagB``)::

    $ curl -u APIKEY: "https://storage.scrapinghub.com/jobq/53/count"
    2
    $ curl -u APIKEY: "https://storage.scrapinghub.com/jobq/53/count?has_tag=tagA&has_tag=tagB"
    2
    $ curl -u APIKEY: "https://storage.scrapinghub.com/jobq/53/count?lacks_tag=tagA&lacks_tag=tagB"
    0

Examples
^^^^^^^^

**List jobs for a given project**

HTTP::

    $ curl -u APIKEY: https://storage.scrapinghub.com/jobq/53/list
    {"key":"53/7/81","ts":1397762393489}
    {"key":"53/7/80","ts":1395111612849}
    {"key":"53/7/78","ts":1393972804722}
    {"key":"53/7/77","ts":1393972734215}


**List jobs finished between two timestamps**

If you pass the ``startts`` and ``endts`` parameters, the API will return only the jobs finished between them.

HTTP::

    $ curl -u APIKEY: "https://storage.scrapinghub.com/jobq/53/list?startts=1359774955431&endts=1359774955440"
    {"key":"53/6/7","ts":1359774955439}
    {"key":"53/3/3","ts":1359774955437}
    {"key":"53/9/1","ts":1359774955431}


**Retrieve jobs finished after some job**

JobQ returns the list of jobs, with the most recently finished first. We recommend associating the key of the most recently finished job with the downloaded data. When you want to update your data later on, you can list the jobs and stop at the previously downloaded job, through the ``stop`` parameter.

Using HTTP::

    $ curl -u APIKEY: "https://storage.scrapinghub.com/jobq/53/list?stop=53/7/81"
    {"key":"53/7/83","ts":1403610146780}
    {"key":"53/7/82","ts":1397827910849}
