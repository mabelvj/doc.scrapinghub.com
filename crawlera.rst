Crawlera API

.. note:: Check also the `Help Center`_ for general guides and articles.

Proxy API
=========

Crawlera works with a standard HTTP web proxy API, where you only need an API
key for authentication. This is the standard way to perform a request via
Crawlera::

    curl -vx proxy.crawlera.com:8010 -U <API key>: http://httpbin.org/ip

Errors
======

When an error occurs, Crawlera sends a response containing an :ref:`x-crawlera-error` header and an error message in the body.

.. note:: These errors are internal to Crawlera and are subject to change at any time, so should not be relied on and only used for debugging.

\* Crawlera limits the number of concurrent connections based on your Crawlera plan. See: `Crawlera pricing table <https://scrapinghub.com/crawlera>`_ for more information on plans.

.. _sessions-request-limits:

Sessions
========

Sessions
--------

Sessions allow reusing the same slave for every request. Sessions expire 30 minutes after their last use and Crawlera limits the number of concurrent sessions to 100 for C10 plans, and 5000 for all other plans.

Sessions are managed using the :ref:`x-crawlera-session` header. To create a new session send::

    X-Crawlera-Session: create

Crawlera will respond with the session ID in the same header::

    X-Crawlera-Session: <session ID>

From then onward, subsequent requests can be made through the same slave by sending the session ID in the request header::

    X-Crawlera-Session: <session ID>

Another way to create sessions is using the `/sessions` endpoint::

    curl -u <API key>: proxy.crawlera.com:8010/sessions -X POST

This will also return a session ID which you can pass to future requests with the `X-Crawlera-Session` header like before. This is helpful when you can't get the next request using `X-Crawlera-Session`.

If an incorrect session ID is sent, Crawlera responds with a ``bad_session_id`` error.


.. _/sessions:

List sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the endpoint :ref:`/sessions` with the ``GET`` method to list your sessions. The endpoint returns a JSON document in which each key is a session ID and the associated value is a slave.

*Example*::

    curl -u <API key>: proxy.crawlera.com:8010/sessions
    {"1836172": "<SLAVE1>", "1691272": "<SLAVE2>"}

.. _/sessions/SESSION_ID:

Delete a session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the endpoint :ref:`/sessions/SESSION_ID` with the ``DELETE`` method in order to delete a session.

*Example*::

    curl -u <API key>: proxy.crawlera.com:8010/sessions/1836172 -X DELETE

Session Request Limits
----------------------

There is a default delay of 12 seconds between each request using the same IP. These delays can differ for more popular domains. If the requests per second limit is exceeded, further requests will be delayed for up to 15 minutes. Each request made after exceeding the limit will increase the request delay. If the request delay reaches the soft limit (120 seconds), then each subsequent request will contain :ref:`x-crawlera-next-request-in` header with the calculated delay as the value.


Request Headers
===============

Crawlera supports multiple HTTP headers to control its behaviour.

Not all headers are available in every plan, here is a chart of the headers available in each plan (C10, C50, etc):

============================== === === ==== ==== ==========
Header                         C10 C50 C100 C200 Enterprise
============================== === === ==== ==== ==========
:ref:`x-crawlera-ua`               ✔   ✔    ✔    ✔
:ref:`x-crawlera-profile`          ✔   ✔    ✔    ✔
:ref:`x-crawlera-no-bancheck`      ✔   ✔    ✔    ✔
:ref:`x-crawlera-cookies`      ✔   ✔   ✔    ✔    ✔
:ref:`x-crawlera-timeout`      ✔   ✔   ✔    ✔    ✔
:ref:`x-crawlera-session`      ✔   ✔   ✔    ✔    ✔
:ref:`x-crawlera-jobid`        ✔   ✔   ✔    ✔    ✔
:ref:`x-crawlera-max-retries`  ✔   ✔   ✔    ✔    ✔
============================== === === ==== ==== ==========

.. _x-crawlera-ua:

X-Crawlera-UA
-------------
:sub:`Only available on C50, C100, C200 and Enterprise plans.`

**Deprecated.** Use :ref:`x-crawlera-profile` instead.

This header controls Crawlera User-Agent behaviour. The supported values are:

* ``pass`` - pass the User-Agent as it comes on the client request
* ``desktop`` - use a random desktop browser User-Agent
* ``mobile`` - use a random mobile browser User-Agent

If ``X-Crawlera-UA`` isn’t specified, it will default to ``desktop``. If an unsupported value is passed in ``X-Crawlera-UA`` header, Crawlera replies with a ``540 Bad Header Value``.

More User-Agent types will be supported in the future (``chrome``, ``firefox``) and added to the list above.

.. _x-crawlera-profile:

X-Crawlera-Profile
------------------
:sub:`Only available on C50, C100, C200 and Enterprise plans.`

This is a replacement of ``X-Crawlera-UA`` header with slightly
different behaviour: ``X-Crawlera-UA`` only sets ``User-Agent`` header
but ``X-Crawlera-Profile`` applies a set of headers which actually used
by the browser. For example, all modern browsers set ``Accept-Language``
and ``Accept-Encoding`` headers. Also, some browsers set ``DNT`` and
``Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`` headers.

We provide *correct default values* for the headers sent by the mimicked
browser but if you set your own header, we will use it instead. For
example, by default Crawlera will send ``Accept-Encoding: identity``
header so if you want to have compressed responses, simply pass
``Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`` in your request. Also, by default
Crawlera mimics browser with *en-US locale* so if you want to override
that, provide ``Accept-Language`` header.

For better experience, we recommend to use as much default values
as possible: your clients **should avoid** sending ``Accept`` or
``Accept-Language`` headers, Crawlera will choose browser values
instead. To use default headers from Crawlera you need either to remove
them from your request or set them blank.

This header’s intent is to replace legacy ``X-Crawlera-UA`` so if
you pass both ``X-Crawlera-UA`` and ``X-Crawlera-Profile``, the latter
supersedes ``X-Crawlera-UA``.

*Example*::

    X-Crawlera-UA: desktop
    X-Crawlera-Profile: pass

Crawlera won’t respect ``X-Crawlera-UA`` setting here because
``X-Crawlera-Profile`` is set.

Supported values for this headers are:

* ``pass`` - do not use any browser profile, use User-Agent, provided by the client
* ``desktop``- use a random desktop browser profile ignoring client User-Agent header
* ``mobile`` - use a random mobile browser profile ignoring client User-Agent header

By default, no profile is used. Crawlera starts to process
``X-Crawlera-UA`` header. If an unsupported value is passed in
``X-Crawlera-Profile`` header, Crawlera replies with a ``540 Bad Header
Value``.

.. _x-crawlera-no-bancheck:

X-Crawlera-No-Bancheck
----------------------
:sub:`Only available on C50, C100, C200 and Enterprise plans.`

This header instructs Crawlera not to check responses against its ban rules and pass any received response to the client. The presence of this header (with any value) is assumed to be a flag to disable ban checks.

*Example*::

    X-Crawlera-No-Bancheck: 1

.. _x-crawlera-cookies:

X-Crawlera-Cookies
------------------

This header allows to disable internal cookies tracking performed by Crawlera.

*Example*::

    X-Crawlera-Cookies: disable

.. _x-crawlera-session:

X-Crawlera-Session
------------------

This header instructs Crawlera to use sessions which will tie requests to a particular slave until it gets banned.

*Example*::

    X-Crawlera-Session: create

When ``create`` value is passed, Crawlera creates a new session an ID of which will be returned in the response header with the same name. All subsequent requests should use that returned session ID to prevent random slave switching between requests. Crawlera sessions currently have maximum lifetime of 30 minutes. See :ref:`sessions-request-limits` for information on the maximum number of sessions.

.. _x-crawlera-jobid:

X-Crawlera-JobId
----------------

This header sets the job ID for the request (useful for tracking requests in the Crawlera logs).

*Example*::

    X-Crawlera-JobId: 999

.. _x-crawlera-max-retries:

X-Crawlera-Max-Retries
----------------------

.. note:: This header has no effect when using :ref:`x-crawlera-session` header.

This header limits the number of retries performed by Crawlera.

*Example*::

    X-Crawlera-Max-Retries: 1

Passing ``1`` in the header instructs Crawlera to do up to 1 retry. Default number of retries is 5 (which is also the allowed maximum value, the minimum being 0).

.. _x-crawlera-timeout:

X-Crawlera-Timeout
------------------

This header sets Crawlera's timeout in milliseconds for receiving a response from the target website. The timeout must be specified in milliseconds and be between 30,000 and 180,000. It's not possible to set the timeout higher than 180,000 milliseconds or lower than 30,000 milliseconds, it will be rounded to its nearest maximum or minimum value.

*Example*::

    X-Crawlera-Timeout: 40000

The example above sets the response timeout to 40,000 milliseconds. In the case of a streaming response, each chunk has 40,000 milliseconds to be received. If no response is received after 40,000 milliseconds, a 504 response will be returned. If not specified, it will default to ``30000``.

[Deprecated] X-Crawlera-Use-Https
---------------------------------

Previously the way to perform https requests needed the http variant of the url plus the header `X-Crawlera-Use-Https` with value `1` like the following example:

::

    curl -x proxy.crawlera.com:8010 -U <API key>: http://twitter.com -H x-crawlera-use-https:1

Now you can directly use the https url and remove the `X-Crawlera-Use-Https` header, like this:

::

    curl -x proxy.crawlera.com:8010 -U <API key>: https://twitter.com

If you don't use curl for crawlera you can check the rest of the documentation
and update your scripts in order to continue using crawlera without issues.
Also some programming languages will ask for the Certificate
file :download:`crawlera-ca.crt`. You can install the certificate on your
system or set it explicitely on the script.

Response Headers
================

.. _x-crawlera-next-request-in:

X-Crawlera-Next-Request-In
--------------------------

This header is returned when response delay reaches the soft limit (120 seconds) and contains the calculated delay value. If the user ignores this header, the hard limit (1000 seconds) may be reached, after which Crawlera will return HTTP status code ``503`` with delay value in ``Retry-After`` header.

X-Crawlera-Debug
----------------

This header activates tracking of additional debug values which are returned in response headers. At the moment only ``request-time`` and ``ua`` values are supported, comma should be used as a separator. For example, to start tracking request time send::

    X-Crawlera-Debug: request-time

or, to track both request time and User-Agent send::

    X-Crawlera-Debug: request-time,ua

The ``request-time`` option forces Crawlera to output to the response header a request time (in seconds) of the last request retry (i.e. the time between Crawlera sending request to a slave and Crawlera receiving response headers from that slave)::

    X-Crawlera-Debug-Request-Time: 1.112218

The ``ua`` option allows to obtain information about the actual User-Agent which has been applied to the last request (useful for finding reasons behind redirects from a target website, for instance)::

    X-Crawlera-Debug-UA: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; zh-CN) AppleWebKit/533+ (KHTML, like Gecko)

.. _x-crawlera-error:

X-Crawlera-Error
----------------

This header is returned when an error condition is met, stating a particular Crawlera error behind HTTP status codes (4xx or 5xx). The error message is sent in the response body.

*Example*::

    X-Crawlera-Error: user_session_limit

.. note:: Returned errors are internal to Crawlera and are subject to change at any time, so should not be relied on.
